## Summary:

One failed terraforming event, two major invasions and nature finally taking order— Earth has gone through so much and it's people have adapted and so has their economical climate. The United Nations Trading and Labor Coalition is just one of the children made from long-gone groups guiding the world; now focused on setting standards and allowing the Earth to shine as a trading hub capital as well as bringing a new source of economical movement to Solis.

- The majority of the ranking system is a based on networking, primarily, but being a hardworking sort does help

- Laborers and Traders that work with the UNTLC are seen as more trustworthy sorts, and usually have the benefit of the Coalition

**Weaknesses/Disadvantages:**
- Corruption is subtle but existent, especially in planets farther than Earth.
