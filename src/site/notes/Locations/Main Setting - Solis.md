### Summary:

Thirty-thousand years into the future, humans have luckily advanced into being a space-faring race, with the added help of the [[Navarians\|Navarians]] , an alien race who sought refuge from a far galaxy. Although there was some trouble adjusting with how individualistic the world had become, this relationship between species turned out to be extremely beneficial in certain aspects, not so much with others. Other races and communities have adapted to our system, and so has Earth, not to mention just how *much* things have changed. Click/Tap any link below to learn more!
